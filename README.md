# Philosophers
**Threads, Mutexes and so on** 

**Philosophers** is a C project developed as part of the 42 School Common Core Program. The primary objective of this project is to create a program that effectively manages data races. Just as in economics, where resources are finite and must be allocated wisely, programming requires careful management of resourcesâ€”typically dataâ€”that need to be accessed by multiple processes or threads. It is essential to ensure that this data remains accurate and reliable. In this context, mutexes are employed to lock the data, preventing concurrent access and ensuring its integrity.

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/138384/en.subject.pdf).

## How to use it

### Getting Started
[![MasterHead](https://github.com/Uatilla/42Porto_FdF/assets/112968804/63113d40-0bba-4d57-90c2-1c9babd6d0c4)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uatilla/)
You just need to download or clone this git repository.
`git@github.com:Uatilla/42Porto_FdF.git`

### Dependencies

To properly run this code you must have the MiniLibX files in the right place, so first you need to **extract the file Source Files/minilibx-linux.tgz to the folder: Project Files/libraries**.
Once done, rename the folder from minilibx-linux to mlx, to know more about what is the MiniLibX library and how it works, please go to this link:  [**42 Docs**](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html
).
Now you can run the program properly, using the following steps:
* Go to the folder Project Files.
* Run `make` to build all necessary files.
* Then run `./fdf ./maps/<select one map>`, you should select one map from the files available in the **maps folder**, for example:
* `./fdf ./maps/t2.fdf`.
* The result must the following:

* Once done, the program will run and the map will be show in a isometric perspective, you can now close pressing ESC or clicking on the close icon (X) on the window.
* To delete all files built except the library you can run: `make clean`.
* To delete all files built including the library you can run: `make fclean`.
* To delete all .o files, library, and rebuild the files to run the program again, run: `make re`.


## Rules

**Norminette:**

The Norminette isÂ a tool provided by 42 Network to check whether the source code complies with the school's norm. The rules include the prohibition of â€˜forâ€™ loops, a limit of 25 lines, and no more than 4 parameters in each function, among other specifications.

Here is a [link](https://42.nauman.cc/2023/06/01/getting-started-norminette/) to more details about what is evaluated by the Norminette tool.

* **MiniLibX Guideline:** Many thank for Andre hernandez (Check his [Github](https://github.com/pulgamecanica)) who built the blog pulgamecanica that help me a lot understand how the MiniLibX works from scratch, you can check it out his amazing blog in these post [link](https://pulgamecanica.herokuapp.com/posts/mlx-starter-pack) and [link](https://pulgamecanica.herokuapp.com/posts/minilibx-tutorial).

* **Bresenham Algorithm:** The wikipedia article helped me understand how the lines are drawn once only the dots coordinates are known [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).
